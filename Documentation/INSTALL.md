## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [ ] Sign-up for a Salesforce Developer Edition account
  - https://developer.salesforce.com/signup
- [ ] Install the Salesforce CLI (SFDX) tool
  - https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/salesforcecli

### SFDX: Authorize Org

`sf org login web --alias paas-cloud-goat --set-default`

Follow the web browser prompts to authorized the CLI

### Org Settings
- Defaults from a Developer Edition account are sufficient
- FYI on Profiles:
  - System Administrator will be used to view all “sensitive app” data
  - Standard User will be the less-privileged user
  - Only “Profiles” are used for authZ; not Roles

1. `sf project deploy start --ignore-conflicts --wait 10`
